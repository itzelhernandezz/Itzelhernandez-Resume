        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Itzel Hernandez, I am from Los Angeles, California. I grew up being around an amazing community always eager to learn new skills. I grew up loving the diversity that LA has brought to different communities. I make it a statement to bring my own cultural background into the projects I work in. I think that being an indigenous community member is important and would love to be a clear representation of who I am without being any less. I have sought  higher education and would love to help those who also seek to receive higher education. I am always open to having conversations on education and what comes with education when it comes to students. I would want the students to feel heard and loved for them and their voices. I am an advocate for students to have the opportunity to receive higher education. I think that better schooling systems should be taken seriously. Having trained teachers to understand students and their backgrounds and how they can help them learn. Iâ€™ve seen numerous students who have not received a proper education due to the lack of a support system, there are students who unfortunately donâ€™t have the ability to get resources such as school supplies, textbooks, tutors, and free transportation. I hope to open up a nonprofit organization where we help students get these resources and more. I would like for everyone to help me out in my goal to open up student success centers across the country, starting off without LA country. We have a huge student population that we would love to help and give them resources to succeed and go ahead to strive for their success. We would also love to promote this organization towards any goals the students may have in mind. Itâ€™s amazing to have a balance when it comes to academics so we would love to have, cooking, arts, designing and coding courses into this nonprofit. Success to the brain is success for the future. I strongly believe that we can all contribute to getting to know each other. We would love to invite many people like enturpenuers to join and have events at our space for students to learn ask questions and we what career paths they would or would not like to take. Realization at an early age is always so nice to welcome because then itâ€™s easy to eliminate things that we are and isnâ€™t interested in too pouring our time into. I would love for everyone to get to know me a little better as we go along with my project in mind. I have grown to love education due to personal experiences and stories shared with me throughout my schooling years. I think that I would continue advocating for a school system in which we are open to having students explain how they think about solutions and why they think that way. Open discussions are where we apply the material being learned to current situations so that we see the greater importance of why we learn. <br><br>
